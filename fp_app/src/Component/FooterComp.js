                The Navigation System is an integrated package which calculates continuously the aircraft position. It may include Inertial Reference System (IRS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) (GPS) inputs in addition to receivers for ground based aids. In the case of an EFIS, the display of these navigational inputs is predicated on the Attitude and Heading Reference System(AHRS).
